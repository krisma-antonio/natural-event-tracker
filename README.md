# Natural Event Tracker Web App

Natural Event Tracker is a web app developed in React, Node, HTML, CSS, and JS for my Capstone 2025 senior project. 

The objective is to enhance individualsâ€™ ability to stay informed about past and active natural events such as droughts, earthquakes, severe storms, wildfires, floods, landslides, dust and haze, sea and lake ice, snow, temperature extremes, and volcanoes occurring in their areas and around the world.
